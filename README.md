# AilaMahmood_FullStack_Week3
Connecting MongoDB Atlas to backend and creating full user signup/login flow.

This week focuses on backend development by integrating MongoDB for data persistence and adding authentication mechanisms like registration, login, JWT protection, and securing API routes.

üìå Objectives
- Integrate MongoDB Atlas with Express using Mongoose.
- Implement secure user registration and login with hashed passwords.
- Use JWT for session management and protect API endpoints.

üîß Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- dotenv

‚úÖ Tasks Completed
1. MongoDB Atlas Setup & Integration
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster was created to store user data securely.
- Connected the cluster to the backend using Mongoose.
- Verified successful connection before launching server.

2. User Schema & Form Data Handling
- A schema was defined to store user details like name, email, and password.
- User registration form data from the frontend is sent to the backend and stored in the MongoDB collection.

3. Authentication System
- Registration: New users can register. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before saving to the database.
- Login: Existing users can log in. Passwords are verified and a JWT is issued upon success.
- Security: JWT tokens are stored on the client side and sent with each request to access protected resources.

4. Securing Protected Routes
- Certain backend routes are secured and accessible only with a valid JWT token.
- Requests without tokens or with invalid tokens are denied access, ensuring user data security.

üöÄ How to Test the Project
- Run the backend server after configuring your .env file with MongoDB URI and JWT secret.
- Use Postman or frontend UI to:
    - Register a new user
    - Log in with credentials to receive a JWT token
    - Use the token to access a protected API route
- Observe behavior for both authorized and unauthorized access.
